# Leinsterskateparks

The purpose of this website is to allow anyone with an ability or interest in skating to get information on some of Leinsters best skateparks as well as encourage meet ups and socialising amongst the limited skaters/ rollerblader and scooterists of Ireland. As a young skater growing up around the Leinster area I often spent lots of time researching good skateparks to visit. Most young skaters like myself would have to use public transport in order to get from A to B and living in Ireland, the day was going to be weather dependant. So having easy access to some of Leinsters best skateparks would save a lot of time researching and hopefully let groups of interesting and talented skaters get together to help grow the sport in Ireland.

The website is made of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The project is related to User Expereince so I have decided to use bright vibrant imagery for my backdrop in order to engage and attract the view of the user. The navigation and layout is also made to be easy for anyone to use with a mobile reponsive navigation bar at the top of the website which will remian throughout my 3 pager structure. 

 
 
 
 ## Navigation Bar:
 This will contain a Home, Skateparks and Contact Page. This will remain the same across all site pages and will follow the user as they scroll to ensure the best overall User Experience.

### Page 1: 
The Home section of this site is going to have a brief about section explaining the purpose of the website as well as its capabilities.
This will also contain a brief section highlighting some of the benefits of skateboarding in Ireland (Socialising/ excercising/ stress relief/ solo sport not required to be in a team). 

### Page 2: 
The Parks section of the site will contain a list of some of Leinsters top rated skateparks, these will be in order of personal preference and usability of each parks features/ ramps/ rails etc. 
I intend for this page to have a ordered top 10 list with an image and description of the park. 
As well as this I intend to include a difficulty progress bar under each skatepark. 

### Page 3:
The Contact page will be a registery form to get contacted about weekly meet ups that take place each weekend throughout the month at a different park. 
As well as the contact form this page will also contain a section about why the Leinsterskateparks group is a good bunch of people who want to promote skating education.
This will also contain several links to social media pages for the group as well as a disclaimer about kids in the group being required to have a guardian present.


# Features

There will be a callout disclaimer on the sign up page requiring children under 18 to have a guardian present when meeting the social group.

Welcome USER_NAME,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
